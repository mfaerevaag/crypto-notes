\subsection{Setup}
\textbf{Public key:} $(n, e)$ where $n = pq$ for primes $p, q$ and $e \in \mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$

\textbf{Private key:} $(p, q, d)$ where $d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$, such that
\[ ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \]

We use $\phi(n)$ because it is hard to compute given only a large $n$, but easy with known $p, q$ since $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$, thus $d$ cannot be easily computed given just $n$ (must prime factor $n$).

\textbf{Encryption:} $m$ is the message. Encryption is
\[ Enc(m) = m^e \mod n \]

\textbf{Decryption:} $c$ is the ciphertext. Decryption is as follows:
\[ Dec(c) \equiv c^d \mod n \]
\[ Dec(c) \equiv m^{ed} \mod n \]

\textbf{Properties of RSA:}

$e$ must be chosen such that it holds that $gcd(\phi(n),e) = 1$, where
$\phi(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$

$n$ must be the product of two large primes $p$ and $q$.
