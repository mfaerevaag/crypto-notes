\subsection{The issue}
Imagine you have encrypted some data using a
symmetric encryption algorithm. What if you then lost the secret key?
If the encryption is strong, your data is unrecoverable.

To avoid this you could have given the secret key to one or more
friends, as a backup. The problem is now is that your friends might
also lose the key. Also, each of your friends can decrypt your
important data.

What if you could give  only shares of the secret key to your
friends, but only need a subset of the shares to reconstruct the
secret key? Now none of your friends can alone decrypt you data, and
it doesn't matter if a friend or two loses their share. This is
\emph{secret sharing}.

\subsection{Shamir's threshold scheme}
\subsubsection*{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item $(t, w)$, where $t$ is the threshold and $w$ is the number of shareholders
\item Participants: Keyholder $H$, shareholders $S_1, \ldots, S_w$
\item Secret key: $k$
\item H chooses:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a prime $p$, such that $p \ge w + 1$
  \item a random polynomial
    \[
    f(x) = k + \sum\limits_{j=1}^{t-1} c_jx^j \mod p
    \]
    of degree $t-1$, where $c_j$s are chosen at random
  \end{itemize}
\item $H$ computes $(x_i, f(x_i))$ for $i  = 1, \ldots, t$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Re-construction}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:lagrange}
    f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t y_1 \prod\limits_{j=1, j\not=i}^t \frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}
  \end{equation}
  \label{asdf}
  \caption{Lagrange Interpolation Formula}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Input: $t$ shares $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, t$
\item $H$ re-constructs the secret key $k$ by using Lagrange Interpolation Formula (\ref{eq:lagrange})
  \[
  k = f(0) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t y_1 \prod\limits_{j=1, j\not=i}^t \frac{x_j}{x_j-x_i}
  \]
\end{itemize}
