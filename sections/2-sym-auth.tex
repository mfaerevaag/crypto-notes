\subsection*{Agenda}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Purpose of authentication
\item Symmetric-key authentication
\item Public-key authentication
\item RSA
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Purpose}
Retain data integrity. Bob can validate that a message is the original one sent from Alice, i.e. that Eve has not forged it. \emph{Not} about keeping data secret.

\subsection{Symmetric-key authentication}
Known as \texttt{MAC}, Message Authentication Code.

\end{center}

\textbf{Disadvantages:} key must be shared over secure channel, requires unique key for pairs of commuicating people.

\textbf{Advantages:} simple to use, fast computations

\subsection{Public-key authentication}
Signs with \emph{private} key, verifies with \emph{public} key (reverse of pub-key encryption/decryptions).

\end{center}

\textbf{Advantages:} no shared key (does not require secure channel to exchange keys), same public key can be used by everyone.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} existential forgery is trivial, Eve can choose any $s$ and compute corresponding $e_{pub}(s) = m$. Hash functions can solve this.
