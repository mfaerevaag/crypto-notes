\subsubsection{Purpose of authentication}
Retain data integrity. Bob can validate that a message is the original one sent from Alice, i.e. that Eve has not forged it. \emph{Not} about keeping data secret.

\subsubsection{What is symmetric key auth?}
Known as \texttt{MAC}, Message Authentication Code.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} key must be shared over secure channel, requires unique key for pairs of commuicating people.

\textbf{Advantages:} simple to use, fast computations

\subsubsection{What is public key auth?}
Signs with \emph{private} key, verifies with \emph{public} key (reverse of pub-key encryption/decryptions).

\textbf{Advantages:} no shared key (does not require secure channel to exchange keys), same public key can be used by everyone.

\textbf{Disadvantages:} existential forgery is trivial, Eve can choose any $s$ and compute corresponding $e_{pub}(s) = m$. Hash functions can solve this.

\subsubsection{RSA authentication}
$H$ is a publicly known hash function, must be secure.

\textbf{Public key:} $(n, e)$ where $n = pq$ for primes $p, q$ and $e \in \mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$

\textbf{Private key:} $(p, q, d)$ where $d \in \mathbb{Z}_{\phi(n)}^*$, such that
\[ ed \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \]

We use $\phi(n)$ because it is hard to compute given only $n$, but easy with known $p, q$ since $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$, thus $d$ cannot be easily computed given just $n$ (must prime factor $n$).

\textbf{Signature:} $m$ is the message and $x = H(m) \in \mathbb{Z}_n$. Signature is
\[ s = x^d \mod n \]

\textbf{Verification:} $m$ is the message, signature is $s \in \mathbb{Z}_n$. Accept if
\[ x \equiv s^e \mod n \]

$H$ is used to prevent the trivial forgey where Eve can choose any $s$ such that $s = e_{pub}(m)$. She cannot do this since she would need a preimage for $H(m)$ as $s$ otherwise does not sign $H(m)$ but $m$.
